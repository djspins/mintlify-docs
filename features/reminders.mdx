Coco can remind you of tasks, items, and TODOs by sending you a WhatsApp message at the time you specify. This can be a one time reminder or a repeating reminder.

## One-time reminders

One-time reminders will be sent to your WhatsApp number at the time you specify. The reminder message will be personalized to you according to your preferences.

<Note>
  If more than 24 hours have passed since you last messaged Coco, your reminders may begin with English text such as `Hi, it's Coco...`
</Note>

<Warning>
  Coco cannot take actions based on a reminder message. For example, if you ask Coco to `show me the SP500 stock price every morning`, Coco will **not** be able to search the internet when sending you the reminder text.
</Warning>

## Repeating reminders

You can ask Coco to remind you about a task with a specified frequency. A repetition can be multiple times per day, daily, weekly, day of week, etc.

<Tip>
  Hi Coco, remind me every Wednesday and Sunday to water my bird of paradise
</Tip>

## Reminders to your Friends

After saving a contact name and phone number with Coco, you can ask Coco to send them a reminder at the specified time. The specified time for the reminder will be in your timezone, unless you specify with Coco a different timezone for the reminder.

<Tip>
  Coco, remind Stephen to wear his Tuxedo tomorrow afternoon.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Repeating reminders to friends are not supported.
</Warning>

## Saving Reminders to Calendar

If you have connected your [Calendar](/features/calendar) to Coco, you may select a calendar to save your reminders to. This is turned **off** by **default**. To select a calendar, login to your Dashboard and select a calendar from the Settings. Reminders will be saved as 10 minute events.
