## One-time reminders

One-time reminders will be sent to your WhatsApp number at the time you specify. The reminder message will be personalized to you according to your preferences.

  If more than 24 hours have passed since you last messaged Coco, your reminders may begin with English text such as `Hi, it's Coco...`
