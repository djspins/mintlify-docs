Coco helps you create and manage lists for anything - shopping lists, to-do lists, gift ideas, travel packing lists, and more. Your lists are accessible both through WhatsApp and your Dashboard.

## Creating Lists

You can create a new list by asking Coco to add items to a list that doesn't exist yet, or by explicitly requesting a new list.

<Tip>
  Add milk and eggs to my shopping list
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Create a new list called "Weekend Project Ideas"
</Tip>

## Adding Items to Lists

Once you have a list, you can easily add new items by mentioning the list name and the items you want to add.

<Tip>
  Add "finish presentation" to my work tasks list
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Put chocolate and flowers on my gift ideas list
</Tip>

## Viewing Lists

Ask Coco to show you any of your lists to see all the items currently on them. You can also view your lists on the Dashboard.

<Tip>
  Show me my shopping list
</Tip>

<Tip>
  What's on my travel packing list?
</Tip>

## Modifying Lists

You can remove items from lists, rename lists, or clear entire lists through simple WhatsApp messages.

<Tip>
  Remove milk from my shopping list
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Clear my completed tasks list
</Tip>

## Sharing Lists

Lists can be shared with other Coco users through your Dashboard. Shared lists appear with "(owned by [name/number])" to indicate who created them.

<Warning>
  List sharing is only available through the Dashboard - you cannot share lists directly through WhatsApp.
</Warning>

After your share a list with one or more contacts, both you and them can add or remove items from the list. You may remove items that other people have added to the list, but it is not possible to edit a list item that someone else has added.

## List Management Tips

Here are some best practices for using Coco's list feature effectively:

- **Use descriptive list names** - "Work Tasks" instead of just "Tasks"
- **Create separate lists for different purposes** - Don't mix shopping items with work tasks
