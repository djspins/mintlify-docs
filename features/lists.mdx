Coco helps you create and manage lists for anything - shopping lists, to-do lists, gift ideas, travel packing lists, and more. Your lists are accessible both through WhatsApp and your Dashboard.

## Creating Lists

You can create a new list by asking Coco to add items to a list that doesn't exist yet, or by explicitly requesting a new list.

<Tip>
Add milk and eggs to my shopping list
</Tip>

<Tip>
Create a new list called "Weekend Project Ideas"
</Tip>

## Adding Items to Lists

Once you have a list, you can easily add new items by mentioning the list name and the items you want to add.

<Tip>
Add "finish presentation" to my work tasks list
</Tip>

<Tip>
Put chocolate and flowers on my gift ideas list
</Tip>

## Viewing Lists

Ask Coco to show you any of your lists to see all the items currently on them.

<Tip>
Show me my shopping list
</Tip>

<Tip>
What's on my travel packing list?
</Tip>

## Modifying Lists

You can remove items from lists, rename lists, or clear entire lists through simple WhatsApp messages.

<Tip>
Remove milk from my shopping list
</Tip>

<Tip>
Clear my completed tasks list
</Tip>

<Note>
When removing items, make sure to be specific about the item name and list to avoid accidentally removing the wrong item.
</Note>

## Sharing Lists

Lists can be shared with other Coco users through your Dashboard. Shared lists appear with "(owned by [name/number])" to indicate who created them.

<Warning>
List sharing is only available through the Dashboard - you cannot share lists directly through WhatsApp.
</Warning>

## List Management Tips

Here are some best practices for using Coco's list feature effectively:

- **Use descriptive list names** - "Work Tasks" instead of just "Tasks"
- **Be specific with item names** - "Buy organic milk" instead of just "milk"
- **Create separate lists for different purposes** - Don't mix shopping items with work tasks
- **Review lists regularly** - Ask Coco to show your lists to keep them up to date

## List Examples

Here are some popular types of lists that Coco users create:

| List Type | Example Items |
|-----------|---------------|
| Shopping List | Milk, bread, apples, toothpaste |
| Work Tasks | Finish report, email client, team meeting prep |
| Gift Ideas | Book for mom, gaming headset, concert tickets |
| Travel Packing | Passport, chargers, medications, comfortable shoes |
| Movie Watchlist | Latest Marvel movie, documentary on Netflix |
| Restaurant List | New Italian place downtown, sushi spot recommended by friend |

## Managing Multiple Lists

Coco can help you manage multiple lists simultaneously. You can have as many lists as you need, and Coco will keep track of them all.

<Tip>
What lists do I have?
</Tip>

This command will show you all your existing lists, making it easy to remember what you're tracking.
