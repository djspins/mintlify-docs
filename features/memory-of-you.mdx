Coco has an advanced memory system that remembers important details about your life, preferences, and past conversations. This allows Coco to provide increasingly personalized and relevant assistance over time.

## How Memory Works

Coco automatically learns from your conversations and stores relevant information to make future interactions more helpful and personalized.

<Note>
Memory features are available for paid plan users. Free plan users have limited memory capabilities.
</Note>

## What Coco Remembers

Coco keeps track of various types of information to better assist you:

### Personal Preferences
- **Communication style** - Whether you prefer formal or casual language, emojis, specific languages
- **Reminder preferences** - How you like to be reminded, timing preferences
- **Notification settings** - When and how often you want to receive messages

<Tip>
Coco, please use more emojis when you message me
</Tip>

<Tip>
Call me "Alex" instead of using my full name
</Tip>

### Important Life Details
- **Work schedule** - Your typical working hours and important work events
- **Family and relationships** - Important people in your life and their details
- **Interests and hobbies** - Things you enjoy doing and talking about
- **Location and travel** - Where you live, places you visit frequently

### Conversation History
Coco can recall previous conversations and topics you've discussed, making it easy to pick up where you left off.

<Tip>
What did we talk about last week regarding my vacation plans?
</Tip>

<Tip>
Remind me what I said about changing my workout routine
</Tip>

## Updating Your Preferences

You can actively update your preferences by telling Coco about changes in your life or how you'd like things to work differently.

<Tip>
I moved to a new city, update my location to Denver
</Tip>

<Tip>
I prefer to receive reminders 15 minutes early instead of 5 minutes
</Tip>

## Searching Your Memory

Use Coco's memory search to find information from your past conversations and stored preferences.

<Tip>
What do you remember about my gym schedule?
</Tip>

<Tip>
Search our conversations about restaurant recommendations
</Tip>

## Memory vs Calendar Events

It's important to understand the difference between Coco's memory and calendar functionality:

| Feature | Memory Search | Calendar Search |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Purpose | Past conversations and preferences | Scheduled events and appointments |
| Content | Personal details, discussion topics | Meetings, appointments, calendar events |
| Use Case | "What did I tell you about..." | "What meetings do I have..." |

<Warning>
Use memory search for personal information and past conversations. Use calendar search for scheduled events and appointments.
</Warning>

## Privacy and Memory

Coco takes your privacy seriously when it comes to stored information:

- **Secure storage** - Your personal information is encrypted and securely stored
- **User control** - You can ask Coco to forget specific information or update incorrect details
- **Purposeful use** - Memory is only used to improve your experience with Coco

<Note>
You can ask Coco to forget specific information if you no longer want it remembered: "Forget my old work schedule" or "Update my preferred reminder time."
</Note>

## Benefits of Memory

### Personalized Responses

### Contextual Understanding

### Proactive Assistance
