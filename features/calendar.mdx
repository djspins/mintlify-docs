Coco can connect to multiple Google and Outlook calendars, allowing you to search, create, edit, and delete events directly through WhatsApp conversations. This powerful integration keeps your schedule synchronized across all your devices.

## Connecting Your Calendar

To connect your calendar to Coco, login to your Dashboard and navigate to the Calendar settings. You can connect multiple calendar accounts from both Google and Outlook accounts.

After your calendars are connected, you may select a **Default Calendar**. You may _optionally_ select which calendar to save your [reminders](/features/reminders) to (by default, reminders will not be saved to calendar).

After connecting your account, you may enable or disable certain calendars from being used with Coco.

<Note>
  Calendar events are different from reminders. Coco will **_not_** send you a WhatsApp text before a regular events. Coco only sends WhatsApp texts for Reminders.
</Note>

## Creating Calendar Events

You can ask Coco to create events on your connected calendars. You may specify:

- Start & End time
- Name
- Repeating frequency
- All-Day event or not
- People to invite to the meeting (ex., email addresses)
- Location
- Description

All new events will be saved to your **Default Calendar**. The default calendar can be changed on the dashboard. Alternatively, you can tell Coco which calendar to add the event to.
