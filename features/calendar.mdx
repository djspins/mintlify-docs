Coco can connect to multiple Google and Outlook calendars, allowing you to search, create, edit, and delete events directly through WhatsApp conversations. This powerful integration keeps your schedule synchronized across all your devices.

## Connecting Your Calendar

To connect your calendar to Coco, login to your Dashboard and navigate to the Calendar settings. You can connect multiple calendar accounts from both Google and Outlook accounts.

After your calendars are connected, you may select which calendar will be used for **New Events**. You may _optionally_ select which calendar to save your [reminders](/features/reminders) to.

<Note>
  Calendar events are different from reminders. Coco will NOT send a WhatsApp reminder before a regular events. Coco only sends WhatsApp texts for Reminders.
</Note>

## Creating Calendar Events

You can ask Coco to create events on your connected calendars. You may specify:

- Start & End time
- Name
- Repeating frequency
- All-Day event or not
- People to invite to the meeting (their email addresses)
- Location
- Description

<Warning>
  We do not yet support specifying which calendar to save new events to over WhatsApp. You must change the New Events calendar on your Dashboard.

  This feature is coming soon\!

  Coco, create a meeting called "Team Standup" tomorrow at 9am and invite Katie from last week

## Search Your Calendar

Coco can search through all your connected calendars to find specific events or check your schedule. You may also include or exclude certain calendars from being searched on the Dashboard.

## Editing Events

You can modify existing calendar events by asking Coco to change specific details. Coco can update any of the fields that can be specified in the Create New Event section

Coco can delete single events or entire recurring series.

  For recurring events, Coco will ask whether you want to delete just one instance or the entire series. Be specific about your intent.

## Calendar vs Reminders

Understanding the difference between calendar events and reminders:

| ---------------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| WhatsApp notifications | No              | Yes       |
