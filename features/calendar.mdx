Coco can connect to multiple Google and Outlook calendars, allowing you to search, create, edit, and delete events directly through WhatsApp conversations. This powerful integration keeps your schedule synchronized across all your devices.

## Connecting Your Calendar

To connect your calendar to Coco, login to your Dashboard and navigate to the Calendar settings. You can connect multiple calendars from both Google and Outlook accounts.

<Tip>
Connect multiple calendars to keep all your schedules in one place - work, personal, family calendars, and more.
</Tip>

## Creating Calendar Events

You can ask Coco to create events on your connected calendars. Simply specify the event details and which calendar to use.

<Tip>
Coco, create a meeting called "Team Standup" tomorrow at 9am on my work calendar
</Tip>

<Note>
Calendar events are different from reminders. Events are saved to your calendar but do NOT trigger WhatsApp reminder messages.
</Note>

## Searching Events

Coco can search through all your connected calendars to find specific events or check your schedule.

<Tip>
What meetings do I have this week?
</Tip>

<Tip>
Do I have anything scheduled for Friday afternoon?
</Tip>

## Editing Events

You can modify existing calendar events by asking Coco to change specific details. Coco can update:
- Event title and description
- Start and end times
- Location
- Attendees
- Recurrence patterns

<Tip>
Move my dentist appointment to next Tuesday at 2pm
</Tip>

## Deleting Events

Remove events from your calendar by asking Coco to delete them. You can delete single events or entire recurring series.

<Warning>
For recurring events, Coco will ask whether you want to delete just one instance or the entire series. Be specific about your intent.
</Warning>

## Recurring Events

Coco supports creating and managing recurring events with various patterns - daily, weekly, monthly, or custom frequencies.

<Note>
Unlike reminders which can have multiple recurrence rules, calendar events may only contain a single recurrence pattern.
</Note>

## Calendar vs Reminders

Understanding the difference between calendar events and reminders:

| Feature | Calendar Events | Reminders |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| WhatsApp notifications | No | Yes |
| Saved to calendar | Yes | Optional |
| Recurring patterns | Single rule only | Multiple rules supported |

1. Login to your Dashboard
2. Go to Calendar Settings  
3. Select a calendar for saving reminders
4. Reminders will be saved as 10-minute events on your chosen calendar
